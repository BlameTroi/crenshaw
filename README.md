# Crenshaw's Compiler Tutorial

Copies of Crenshaw's popular tutorial and my working through it using Free Pascal. Just an exercise to keep my hand in. 

## Notes on Style

This code is written with Free Pascal 3.22 using the objfpc mode {$MODE objfpc} and AnsiStrings {$H+}. This means:

* integers are longints
* strings may be arbitrarily long and will have a trailing null character but embedded nulls are allowed.
* exceptions are available may be used
* dynamic arrays are available and may be used
* object orientation is avoided
